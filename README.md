# Story
# This is a Social media platform crafted with help of MERN Stack
# There are two folders in the first folder there is client which act as our frontend or the client of the application and then we have our backend in server folder.
# We used the database here as mongoDB Atlas
# By dafault the Port:5001 for server and for client the port:5100.

## To Start Server
# After directing to server directory install dependencies with (npm i) command and then start server with (nodemon server.js or node server.js).

## To start Client
# After going to directory of client hit command (npm i) to install all dependencies adn then use the command (npm start) to run frontend on port 5100.
